## Coding Guidelines

### JavaScript Style

- Use ES6+ features
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions where appropriate
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names

### Example:

```javascript
// Good
const calculateSMA = (prices, window) => {
  const slice = prices.slice(-window);
  return slice.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / slice.length;
};

// Avoid
function calc(p, w) {
  var s = p.slice(-w);
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    sum += s[i];
  }
  return sum / s.length;
}
```

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

### Example:

```
Add RSI indicator filter

- Implement RSI calculation
- Add configuration options
- Update documentation
- Add tests

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Test with paper trading before suggesting live trading features
- Include edge cases in tests

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add comments to complex code
- Update relevant docs in `/docs` folder
- Include examples for new features

## Strategy Contributions

If you're contributing a new trading strategy:

1. Create a new file in `src/strategies/`
2. Follow the existing strategy interface
3. Include comprehensive comments
4. Add documentation in `docs/`
5. Test thoroughly with paper trading
6. Include risk warnings

## Security
