## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: [your-email@example.com]

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Security Best Practices

### For Users:

1. **API Keys**
   - Never commit your `.env` file
   - Never share your API keys
   - Use paper trading for testing
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. **Environment**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use Node.js LTS version
   - Run on secure systems
   - Monitor bot activity

3. **Trading**
   - Start with paper trading
   - Use small position sizes
   - Set appropriate stop losses
   - Never risk more than you can afford to lose

4. **Code**
   - Review code before running
   - Don't run untrusted strategies
   - Keep your bot updated
   - Monitor for unusual behavior

### For Contributors:

1. **Code Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Avoid eval() and similar functions
   - Sanitize user inputs

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review dependency security advisories
   - Use `npm audit` regularly
   - Minimize dependency count

3. **API Integration**
   - Use HTTPS only
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Log security events

4. **Data Protection**
   - Never log sensitive data
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use secure communication channels
   - Implement proper access controls

## Known Security Considerations

### API Keys
- API keys are stored in `.env` file
- Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- Never commit API keys to version control

### Paper Trading
- Bot defaults to paper trading
- Verify `ALPACA_PAPER=true` before running
- Double-check before switching to live trading

### Network Security
- Bot communicates with Alpaca API over HTTPS
- Ensure your network connection is secure
- Consider using VPN for additional security

### Rate Limiting
- Alpaca API has rate limits
- Bot implements basic error handling
- Excessive requests may result in temporary bans

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure policy:

1. **Report**: Security researcher reports vulnerability privately
2. **Acknowledge**: We acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
3. **Investigate**: We investigate and develop a fix
4. **Fix**: We release a patch
5. **Disclose**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability after fix is released

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. Users will be notified via:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- README updates

## Compliance

This project:
- Does not store user financial data
- Does not process payments
- Uses third-party APIs (Alpaca) for trading
- Follows Alpaca's security guidelines
