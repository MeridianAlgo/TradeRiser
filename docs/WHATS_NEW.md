## 🚀 What This Means for You

### Better Risk Management
Every trade now has:
- **Take Profit:** Automatically sells when you're up 3%
- **Stop Loss:** Automatically sells when you're down 1.5%

### More Predictable Results
- You know your max loss per trade: 1.5%
- You know your profit target: 3%
- No more holding losing positions hoping they recover

### Professional Trading
This is how professional traders manage risk:
1. Enter on a signal (MA crossover)
2. Set TP and SL immediately
3. Let the trade play out
4. Move on to the next trade
