# 🔧 Fixes & Improvements - What's Been Fixed

## ✅ Major Fix: Multiple Buy Issue SOLVED!

### The Problem:
Bot was buying multiple times for the same symbol:
```
10:15:24 PM - BUY order placed: 0.17 BTC/USD
10:16:25 PM - BUY order placed: 0.14 BTC/USD  ← DUPLICATE!
```

### The Solution:
Added position tracking to ensure **ONE POSITION AT A TIME** per symbol.

### How It Works Now:
1. Bot checks if it already has a position
2. If yes → HOLD (wait for TP/SL to exit)
3. If no → Look for entry signal
4. After buying → Mark position as active
5. After selling → Clear position flag

### Code Changes:
```javascript
// Added position tracking
this.hasPosition = {};  // Track positions per symbol

// Check before buying
if (this.hasPosition[symbol]) {
  console.log('Already have a position, waiting for exit...');
  return 'HOLD';
}

// Mark position after buying
this.hasPosition[symbol] = true;

// Clear position after selling
this.hasPosition[symbol] = false;
```

## 🎯 New Features Added

### 1. **RSI Filter** (Optional)
Prevents buying when price is overbought.

**Enable:**
```javascript
this.useRSI = true;
```

**What it does:**
- Checks RSI before buying
- If RSI > 70 (overbought) → Skip trade
- Reduces false signals

### 2. **Volume Filter** (Optional)
Only buys on high volume moves.

**Enable:**
```javascript
this.useVolume = true;
```

**What it does:**
- Checks if volume is above average
- Only buys when volume confirms the move
- Filters out weak signals

### 3. **EMA Option** (Optional)
Use EMA instead of SMA for faster signals.

**Enable:**
```javascript
this.useEMA = true;
```

**What it does:**
- Uses Exponential Moving Average
- Reacts faster to price changes
- Better for volatile markets

### 4. **Additional Indicators Available**
- MACD (trend momentum)
- Bollinger Bands (volatility)
- ATR (dynamic stop loss)

All built-in and ready to use!

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### 1. **Lagging Indicators**
MA crossovers are lagging - you enter after the move starts.

**Solution:** Use faster MAs (5/15) or enable EMA

### 2. **Whipsaws in Sideways Markets**
False signals when market is choppy.

**Solution:** Enable RSI and/or volume filters

### 3. **Fixed TP/SL**
Same TP/SL regardless of volatility.

**Solution:** Use ATR for dynamic TP/SL (advanced)

### 4. **No News Awareness**
Bot doesn't know about major news events.

**Solution:** Manually pause bot during major announcements

### 5. **One Position Limit**
Can't scale in/out or hold multiple positions.

**Solution:** This is intentional for simplicity and risk management
