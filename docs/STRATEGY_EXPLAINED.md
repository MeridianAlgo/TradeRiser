# 🎯 Current Strategy Explained - MA Crossover + TP/SL

## 📊 Strategy Overview

**Name:** MA Crossover with Take Profit and Stop Loss  
**Type:** Trend Following + Risk Management  
**Difficulty:** Beginner-Friendly

---

## 🎮 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### Step 1: Wait for Entry Signal
The bot watches two moving averages:
- **Short MA (10 minutes)** - Fast-moving average
- **Long MA (30 minutes)** - Slow-moving average

When the **Short MA crosses ABOVE the Long MA** → This means price is trending UP → **BUY!**

### Step 2: Monitor Position
After buying, the bot watches your profit/loss:
- **Take Profit (TP):** If you gain 3% → **SELL** (lock in profits!)
- **Stop Loss (SL):** If you lose 1.5% → **SELL** (cut losses!)

### Step 3: Repeat
After selling, go back to Step 1 and wait for the next crossover.

## 🎯 Strategy Parameters (Easy to Change!)

Open `strategy.js` and find these lines:

```javascript
// Moving Average Settings (lines 28-29)
this.shortWindow = 10;  // ← Change this for faster/slower signals
this.longWindow = 30;   // ← Change this for faster/slower signals

// Take Profit & Stop Loss (lines 35-36)
this.takeProfitPercent = 3.0;   // ← Change to 5.0 for 5% profit target
this.stopLossPercent = 1.5;     // ← Change to 2.0 for 2% stop loss

// Position Size (line 39)
this.positionSizePercent = 0.1;  // ← 0.1 = 10% of buying power
```

## 🎓 Tips for Success

### 1. Start with Default Settings
Don't change anything at first. Let it run for a few days and observe.

### 2. Adjust Based on Results
- Too many trades? → Increase MA windows
- Not enough trades? → Decrease MA windows
- Hitting SL too often? → Widen the SL
- Want bigger gains? → Increase TP

### 3. Keep a Trading Journal
Write down:
- When trades happened
- Why they happened (what was the signal?)
- Results (profit/loss)
- What you learned

### 4. Test Thoroughly
Use paper trading for at least 1-2 weeks before considering live trading.

### 5. Understand Risk
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- Start with small position sizes
- Crypto is volatile - expect losses sometimes
